# HTML Canvas

This is a respository I'm setting up to practice and learn more deeply about **HTML Canvas**.

I'm planning on using it for some game development, putting some ideas on paper, as well as just learning this powerful tool.

Some of the projects here might be based on a tutorial, others might just be an idea I had and practiced.
